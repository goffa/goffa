Ben Folds - Learn To Live With What You Are

I know that you're in there
I can see you
You're saying you're okay
I don't believe you

And now that gig is up, the spell is broken
The fat lady's sung, the president has spoken
These days that you were waiting for will come and go
Like any day, just another day

There's never gonna be a moment of truth for you
While the world is watching, ohh ohh
Ohh, all you need is the  thing you've forgotten
And that's to learn to live with what you are

So freak out if you wanna
And I'll still be here
Don't call me for years and when you do
Yeah, I'll still be here

And I'm not saying that the effort is a  waste of time, but I
Just want you for the things you couldn't change, but you tried
These hours of confusion they will soon expire like
Everything does

There's never gonna be a moment of truth for you
While the world is watching, ohh ohh
Ohh, all you need is the  thing you've forgotten
And that's to learn to live with what you are

Sometimes everything you've ever wanted floats above
It's stickin' out its tongue and laughing while
Everything that anyone could ever need is down below
Waiting for you, know this

There's never gonna be a moment of truth for you
While the world is watching, ohh ohh
'Cause all you need is the thing you've forgotten
And that's to learn to live with what you are
You've got to learn to live with what you are
You've got to learn to live with what you...
